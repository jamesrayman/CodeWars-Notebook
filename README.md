Presaved code for HP CodeWars

This notebook is written specifically for Windows 10.

* `n init x`: create subdirectories for `prob00` to `probx`
* `n data path`: extract data files from `.\path\`
* `n cd x`: switch to subdirectory `probx`
* `n submit [x]`: if `x` is given `n cd x`, clear `.\submit\` and add the current solution to that directory
* `n test [x]`: if `x` is given `n cd x`, test the current problem, and, if it passes, `n submit`
* `n new [x] ...`: if `x` is given `n cd x`, create a solution in the current directory with `...` as the template additions
* `n help`: print help file
